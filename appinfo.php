		<p>This app was developed by Matthew Stratford (<a href="http://mstratford.co.cc" class="noeffect">mstratford.co.cc</a>) for web developers who want a off-the-shelf mobile template for a radio station. It was developed from iWebkit.</p>

<p>iWebKit has been developed by Christopher Plieger, since september 2008. It 
		started off as a simple and fun test to play with the iPhone Webapp 
		platform.</p>
		<p>As soon as he noticed people were interested in his project and started 
		making real websites with it, he decided to continue the development and 
		add some new features. And since then it has been a real treat for him to 
		develop it more and more and discovering all that he can do with the 
		iPhone and safari!</p>
<p>He has now moved to <a class="noeffect" href="http://snippetspace.com/">SnippetSpace.com</a> to make room for new projects!</p>
